# BAIA - Flutter Mobile App

The BAIA Flutter app is the front-end component of the BAIA system, designed to offer a user-friendly interface for managing and visualizing WhatsApp bot functionalities. This mobile application allows businesses to interact with their bot, customize commands, and monitor interactions in real-time.

## Project Description

The BAIA Flutter app provides an intuitive platform for businesses to manage their WhatsApp bot efficiently. It connects to the Go-based backend API to facilitate various bot management tasks and offers a seamless user experience.

### Key Features

- **Dashboard:** A comprehensive view of bot activity, including recent interactions and performance metrics.
- **Command Customization:** Tools to define and manage custom commands for the bot.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Immediate reflection of changes made in the app on the botâ€™s behavior.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Flutter to ensure a responsive and accessible user experience across different devices.

### Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** Framework for creating a modern, responsive user interface.
- **Dart:** Programming language used for Flutter development.
- **Networking Packages:** To handle communication with the Go-based API and manage data exchanges.

## How It Works

The app communicates with the Go API to manage bot settings and commands. Users interact with the app to update configurations, which are processed by the backend. Real-time feedback ensures that all changes are instantly visible and applied to the bot.
